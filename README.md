# MRI_CV
developed advanced deep learning techniques for accurate brain metastasis segmentation from MRI images. Using  Nested U-Net (U-Net++) and Attention U-Net, enhanced by CLAHE, the models are trained with DICE Score. A FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend enable real-time MRI segmentation for clinical use.
